# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Description

Heavily Inspired by the famous https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg  
This Python script visualizes various sorting algorithms using the Tkinter GUI library.  
It generates a random array of numbers and displays the sorting process in real time as different algorithms are executed.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithm Visualization**: Watch sorting algorithms in action as they progressively sort an array.
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Includes Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Shell Sort, Gnome Sort, Comb Sort, Pancake Sort, and Cocktail Shaker Sort.
- **Interactive UI**: Simple button-based interface to select and execute sorting algorithms.
- **Real-time Updates**: The visualization dynamically updates as the algorithm progresses.
- **Reset Functionality**: Regenerate a new randomized array for further testing.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (if needed):
  ```sh
  pip install tkinter
  ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

Execute the following command to start the sorting visualizer:

```sh
python sorting_visualizer.py
```

### Sorting Algorithms Available

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Shell Sort**
- **Gnome Sort**
- **Comb Sort**
- **Pancake Sort**
- **Cocktail Shaker Sort**

### Interface

- Click on a sorting algorithm button to start sorting.
- Click the **Reset** button to shuffle the array and try again.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more sorting algorithms.
- Improve visualization effects.
- Add speed controls to adjust sorting speed.
- Add Audio Effects
- Create a web-based version for online use.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure Python 3 is installed and working properly.
- If the script does not display the GUI, check that Tkinter is installed.
- If the visualization appears too slow, adjust the sleep duration in the update function.
